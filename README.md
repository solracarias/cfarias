# Carlos Francisco Arias Mejia, PhD

My research focuses on the evolutionary processes and mechanisms driving and constraining the origin of new species in nature. I am particularly interested on how historical and contemporary processes interact to create and maintain intraspecific novel variation. I have been using population genomics approaches to characterize patterns of genome-wide divergence at both local and regional spatial scales within neotropical taxa.
